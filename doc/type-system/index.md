# Type system

In this language, types are much simpler and harder than you'd think at the same time. Still, there are a lot of similarities with C# and Java-like languages, so for anyone who has any Java or C#-related background, getting used to this language's type system won't be too much of a hassle.

Since this lang originally was meant to be a one for one clone of C#, the type system is stronly influenced by OOP, but still, ++C's type system is not 100% OOP, since there's no inheritance, and there won't be any for the forseeable future, so this is basically like the C's type system with generics and polymorphism (from contracts)

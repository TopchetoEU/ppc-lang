# The difference between arguments and parameters

This is a topic that really has to be covered here so you can continue reading this documentation without any misunderstandings.

The parameters tell the user what is being expected, for example, the signature of a function contains parameters, not arguments. Arguments on the other side are the things you match parameters with, for example, you pass arguments to a function when you call it, not parameters.

# Roadmap

Since ++C is such a big project, I want to take my time with implementing it. Here's the general plan of how development process is going to go:

- Tokenization (done)
- Abstract syntax tree (done)
- Structs
- $_int_x types
- Parameterless void functions
- Variables
- Assignments
- Calls
- Void functions with parameters
- Non-void functions with parameters
- Function members
- Operators
- Constructors
- Pointers
- Static and dynamic arrays
